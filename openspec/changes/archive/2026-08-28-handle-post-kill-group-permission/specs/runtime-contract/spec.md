## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Codex execution is read-only and bounded

The Codex adapter SHALL invoke `codex exec` directly and MUST expose distinct
tool-less and agentic execution modes under the same explicit typed model and
reasoning policy. Tool-less mode MUST select the read-only sandbox, disable
shell, browser, computer, app, plugin, image, multi-agent, and collaboration
tools, disable rule loading and persisted sessions, and use strict structured
output. Agentic mode SHALL select the read-only sandbox and disable multi-agent
and collaboration modes while retaining source exploration for explicitly
expanded adjudication only. The adapter MUST capture its newly created process
group before awaiting the runtime and enforce each configured deadline by
cancelling its process-owning task. That task MUST terminate the complete
captured process group with TERM, wait no more than five seconds for the group
to disappear, and escalate to KILL. After KILL, it MUST wait no more than a
further five seconds for the captured group to disappear. If the group still
exists or cannot be verified because a probe receives `EPERM`, it MUST record
persistent or unverified cleanup in the run log and return so the original
cancellation or timeout classification can continue. Runtime identity and
usage MUST record the selected mode so resume cannot reuse a result from
another mode. The initial default policy MUST be `gpt-5.6-sol` with `max`
reasoning effort.

#### Scenario: Tool-less discovery execution

- **WHEN** DISCOVER starts a lane replica
- **THEN** its Codex command disables shell and other interactive tools, writes
  no persisted Codex session, and records zero tool calls in usage

#### Scenario: Expanded adjudication execution

- **WHEN** an initially UNCERTAIN candidate starts its one expanded pass
- **THEN** its Codex command uses agentic read-only mode and can inspect the
  provisioned checkout

#### Scenario: Deadline expires

- **WHEN** a run exceeds its configured deadline
- **THEN** RVW terminates and reaps the full runtime process group and classifies
  the run INVALID with reason `exit_nonzero:124`

#### Scenario: Runtime leader exits before its child

- **WHEN** TERM ends the runtime leader but a child in its captured process group
  remains alive
- **THEN** RVW detects the surviving group during the grace period, sends KILL,
  and returns after the group exits

#### Scenario: Process group persists after KILL

- **WHEN** the captured process group still appears to exist for five seconds
  after RVW sends KILL
- **THEN** RVW records a persistent-cleanup marker and does not wait
  indefinitely before returning the original cancellation or timeout result

#### Scenario: Process group cannot be verified after KILL

- **WHEN** the post-KILL process-group probe receives `EPERM`
- **THEN** RVW records an unverified-cleanup marker and returns the original
  cancellation or timeout result without propagating the probe exception

#### Scenario: Ambient configuration requests a different policy

- **WHEN** a host config selects another model or reasoning effort
- **THEN** an RVW Codex invocation still carries `--model gpt-5.6-sol` and an
  explicit `model_reasoning_effort="max"` override
