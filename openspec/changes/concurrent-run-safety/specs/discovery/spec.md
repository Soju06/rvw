## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Invalid replicas use one all-lane retry

An invalid replica MUST be excluded from finding enrichment, and the dispatcher MUST retry a lane-chunk group exactly once only when every initial replica for that lane and chunk is INVALID. The replacement wave MUST persist its artifacts in a run directory distinct from the initial wave's so the initial INVALID artifacts remain inspectable, while the directory's final component preserves the runtime replica-derivation contract.

#### Scenario: One of three replicas is invalid

- **WHEN** two replicas for one lane-chunk are VALID and one is INVALID
- **THEN** discovery keeps the two valid outputs and does not retry that lane-chunk

#### Scenario: All replicas are invalid

- **WHEN** all three initial replicas for one lane-chunk are INVALID
- **THEN** the dispatcher executes one replacement wave for that lane-chunk and performs no further retry

#### Scenario: Retry preserves initial artifacts

- **WHEN** a lane-chunk's replacement wave completes after an all-INVALID initial wave
- **THEN** the initial wave's prompt, log, and output artifacts are unchanged and the replacement artifacts exist in a separate directory
