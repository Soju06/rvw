# Cloud app platform context

The A0 feasibility spike built a Cloudflare Sandbox Worker outside this repository. This scaffold ports that path into version control while preserving the owner decision that real credentials are injected by `outboundByHost` at egress and never placed in a sandbox process. Wrangler 4.128.0 confirms `image_build_context` is a supported container field; the cloud Dockerfile therefore uses repository-root context for source installation.

The future A1 architecture is webhook → Queue → Sandbox job → GitHub Check Runs API. The GitHub App permissions are checks write, pull requests write, contents read, and metadata read, with pull_request, check_run, and check_suite events. Check-run state starts at `in_progress` and resolves to `success`, `failure`, or `neutral`. Job messages carry a job identifier, installation/repository/PR identifiers, head SHA, source event, attempt, and timestamps. Artifacts are planned for R2 with D1 metadata, but neither is consumed by this change.

Cloudflare API credentials with Containers permissions are not available during this change. CI intentionally uses dry-runs, local Terraform validation, typechecking, and Docker build only. rvw publishes a Terraform module and reusable deployment workflow; deployers provision credentials and secrets in their own repositories.

The 2026-09-02 A0 rerun measured a roughly 3.6-second cold start and a roughly
24.5-minute small review on a `standard-2` instance. Inner
`codex --sandbox read-only` execution works on Cloudflare using Codex's bundled
bubblewrap, unlike the same probe in plain Docker, where namespace creation is
not permitted. These measurements support the Cloudflare execution path but do
not establish a production deadline for larger reviews.

Container application rollout is asynchronous: immediately after an image
update, a fresh sandbox can still run the previous image until application
instances refresh. Deployment readiness therefore requires instance/image
verification rather than assuming Worker deployment completion means the new
container is serving. Cleanup also has three independent scopes. Deleting the
Worker removes neither the container application nor Cloudflare registry
images; operators must delete the Worker, application, and obsolete image tags
separately.
